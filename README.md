# Edge-to-Cloud Agentic AI for Preventive Maintenance

This project outlines a scalable, cloud-integrated architecture for deploying autonomous agentic AI services across multiple factory locations to perform predictive and preventive maintenance. 

## Overview

I wanted to work out how a company could deploy an autonomous agentic AI system to multiple factories equipped with edge devices and local compute (IPCs) to run containerized AI models capable of detecting and acting on early signs of equipment failure. This README is a description of what I have learned regarding how to disseminate a centralized cloud layer while managing, training, and aggregating global reporting, allowing for streamlined operations, reduced downtime, and executive-level oversight.

## Architecture Diagram for Agentic AI for Preventive Maintenance Use Case

CLOUD LAYER

└── Azure Machine Learning
    └── Trains and versions the central AI model
    └── Publishes model containers to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

└── Azure Container Registry (ACR)
    └── Stores versioned containers (AI service, logic, configs)

└── Azure Arc
    └── Connects to each factory’s on-site Kubernetes cluster
    └── Deploys AI containers to registered edge locations

└── Azure Monitor / Log Analytics
    └── Collects performance metrics from edge clusters
    └── Tracks uptime, inference success, error rates

└── Central AI Dashboard (VP of Maintenance)
    └── Aggregates reports + metrics from all sites
    └── Displays trends, cost savings, and maintenance wins

FACTORY / EDGE LAYER (per site)
└── Industrial PC (IPC) running Kubernetes
    └── Hosts the AI agent container (deployed via Arc)
    └── Collects data from factory sensors and machines



DATA FLOW
1. AI model trained → published to ACR
2. Azure Arc pushes container → deployed to factory Kubernetes clusters
3. Local AI makes decisions → alerts plant staff + logs activity
4. Summary reports and metrics sync to cloud
5. Central dashboard provides unified insights to the VP

## Cloud Architecture

- **Azure Machine Learning**: Trains and versions preventive maintenance models.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Hosts versioned containers for deployment.
- **Azure Arc**: Connects and manages remote Kubernetes clusters at factory sites.
- **Azure Monitor**: Collects performance logs and metrics from local deployments.
- **Central AI Dashboard**: Consolidates reports for executive visibility.

---

## 🏭 Edge Architecture (Per Factory)

- **Industrial PC (IPC)**: Hosts a Kubernetes cluster for containerized workloads.
- **Edge Sensors**: Provide real-time equipment telemetry.
- **Local AI Agent**: Processes sensor data and triggers maintenance alerts/actions.
- **Plant Managers**: Respond to AI-triggered actions and verify resolutions.

## Data Flow

1. Central AI model → Published to Azure Container Registry.
2. Azure Arc pushes containers → Edge IPCs running Kubernetes.
3. AI agents at the edge trigger alerts locally.
4. Reports and metrics stream back to Azure.
5. Dashboard displays performance, trends, and cost savings.

## Glossary

- **Azure Arc**: Extends Azure management to on-prem and multi-cloud environments.
- **Edge AI**: AI that operates locally near the data source.
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous, goal-directed AI systems.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Container orchestration system managing deployment and scaling.
- **Industrial PC (IPC)**: Rugged local compute node near factory equipment.

## Deployment Example

```bash
# Tag and push the AI container
docker tag maintenance-ai:v1 myacr.azurecr.io/maintenance-ai:v1
docker push myacr.azurecr.io/maintenance-ai:v1

# Deploy container to remote factory site via Azure Arc
az connectedk8s proxy -n factory-site-cluster
kubectl apply -f maintenance-ai-deployment.yaml
```
