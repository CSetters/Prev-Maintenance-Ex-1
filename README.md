# 🏭 Edge-to-Cloud Agentic AI for Preventive Maintenance

This project outlines a scalable, cloud-integrated architecture for deploying autonomous agentic AI services across multiple factory locations to perform predictive and preventive maintenance.

## 🔍 Overview

Factories are equipped with edge devices and local compute (IPCs) that run containerized AI models capable of detecting and acting on early signs of equipment failure. A centralized cloud layer manages deployment, training, and global reporting, allowing for streamlined operations, reduced downtime, and executive-level oversight.

---

## 🌐 Cloud Architecture

- **Azure Machine Learning**: Trains and versions preventive maintenance models.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Hosts versioned containers for deployment.
- **Azure Arc**: Connects and manages remote Kubernetes clusters at factory sites.
- **Azure Monitor**: Collects performance logs and metrics from local deployments.
- **Central AI Dashboard**: Consolidates reports for executive visibility.

---

## 🏭 Edge Architecture (Per Factory)

- **Industrial PC (IPC)**: Hosts a Kubernetes cluster for containerized workloads.
- **Edge Sensors**: Provide real-time equipment telemetry.
- **Local AI Agent**: Processes sensor data and triggers maintenance alerts/actions.
- **Plant Managers**: Respond to AI-triggered actions and verify resolutions.

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. Central AI model → Published to Azure Container Registry.
2. Azure Arc pushes containers → Edge IPCs running Kubernetes.
3. AI agents at the edge trigger alerts locally.
4. Reports and metrics stream back to Azure.
5. Dashboard displays performance, trends, and cost savings.

## 📘 Glossary

- **Azure Arc**: Extends Azure management to on-prem and multi-cloud environments.
- **Edge AI**: AI that operates locally near the data source.
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous, goal-directed AI systems.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Container orchestration system managing deployment and scaling.
- **Industrial PC (IPC)**: Rugged local compute node near factory equipment.

## 🚀 Deployment Example

```bash
# Tag and push the AI container
docker tag maintenance-ai:v1 myacr.azurecr.io/maintenance-ai:v1
docker push myacr.azurecr.io/maintenance-ai:v1

# Deploy container to remote factory site via Azure Arc
az connectedk8s proxy -n factory-site-cluster
kubectl apply -f maintenance-ai-deployment.yaml
```
